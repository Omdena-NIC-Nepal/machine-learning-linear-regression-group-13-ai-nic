## Steps
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Explore the data, visualize relationships, handle missing values, and preprocess the data.
2. **Model Building and Training:** Build and train a linear regression model.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared, and visualize residuals.
4. **Feature Engineering and Improvement:** (Optional) Experiment with different features to improve the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Joblib

## Running the Project
1. Run the EDA.ipynb to explore the data.
2. Run the Data_Preprocessing.ipynb to preprocess the data.
3. Run the Model_Training.ipynb to train the model.
4. Run the Model_Evaluation.ipynb to evaluate the model.

Alternatively, use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to perform preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
Boston Housing Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
